          Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remain unknown to science. 
          Our role is to discover  and document these bacteria. In particular we are interested in 
          bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. 
          Our lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup to research candidate species.
          <br><br> Labs across the country  have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, 
          and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is still searching for
          the bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. We have a hypothesis that there's a 
          bacteria found on the human body. <br><br> The human body is a source of thousands of types 
          of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacterial species may 
          vary even in the same location. We hypothesize that the ideal bacteria species to make synthetic  
          beef, may be found in someone's belly button. To test our hypothesis we have sampled the 
          navels of people across the county to identify bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. 
          Each persons identity is anonymous and has been assigned and ID number. <br><br> Participants, 
          researchers, scientists, and navel enthusiasts alike will be able to visit this dashboard to
          learn more about the different bacterial species that live in our navels... Who knows what we 
          might find. <br><br>
